1) Sale Agreement - 02nd Nov 2018 with 3 months expiry.

2) Sale Deed - 07th Feb 2019 - Despite Sale Agreement expiry (on 02nd Feb 2019), they requested for extension of Sale Deed registration for another 5 days as their Bank Cheque was not ready. In good faith, I agreed to wait even after sale agreement expiry and did the registration 5 days later (i.e on 07th Feb 2019).

3) Post Sale Deed registration (07th Feb 2019), they mentioned that they are waiting to get building construction approval, but they did the borewell and sump construction immediately.

4) On 14th Feb 2019, Jayachandra called me and told that the measurement for Site No. 58 is inappropriate and he suspects encroachment by Antony. I told him that we had the barb wire fencing done, which Antony has removed during his construction in order to avail the facility of putting his building materials on Site 58. I also sent him an email explaining the same and also attached pictures on email. In good faith, I have sent these to help talk to Antony for removing any encroachment on Site 58.

4) On 15th Feb 2019, Jayachandra had a quarrel with Antony related to the encroachment made by him on the South side. On the same day, he demolished the temporary incomplete boundary wall that Antony has put on Site 58. On the same day, I was informed by the Broker (who made this sale) about the quarrel and since I was in an official presentation/workshop, I immediately sent a message on WhatsApp to Jayachandra's Son (Karthik Jayachandra) to take this up legally. I also told that Mr Jayachandra has to apply for Surveying the land (as he has the ownership of Site 58) and then resolve accordingly with Antony. Additionally, I also told them I will help to get a private Surveyor as the Govt Survey process could take time (almost 21 days) and that could delay his construction. (Note - WhatsApp Messages are available with me for proof and if you need them I can send them as pictures to you)

5) Surveyor visit was done on 1st Mar 2019 and Jayachandra was also there. On that day, Site 58 had done all earth works for foundation. It was more of an obstruction to the Surveyor, but the Surveyor still managed to complete his work. On the same day, Surveyor informed me that the Sump construction done by Jayachandra has encroachement of 2.5 to 3 ft on Site 57. The same was conveyed to Jayachandra and he promised to remove it after getting the Surveyor Map/Drawing. Jayachandra also informed that Antony Land on the West is about 84 ft (frontage) and hence, he has took 3ft of Site 58 claiming that it belongs to him. I asked if he has verified Antony Sale Deed document and he said he did not. I also told him that I will get a copy of Antony Sale Deed so that the encroachment on the South side of Jayachandra's Site 58 can be contested legally.

6) On 07th Mar 2019 I obtained Antony's Land Sale Deed through a friend of mine.

7) On 15th Mar 2019, Surveyor's Finalized Drawing was sent to me on email.

8) On 17th Mar 2019, I visited Bengaluru in the evening. Survey Map & Antony Land document (printed copy) was handed over personally to Jayachandra on that day at his home around 7.30 pm. I explained Jayachandra about the Survey Map for Site 57 and 58 AND also informed that Antony's site measured only 81.7 ft on the West and it starts from the Canal side (South side). After Jayachandra listening to me, he went through these documents and told me that the H.V. Reddy layout (that contains Sites 57 and 58) has Site 58 South side boundary aligned to the rear plots. I told him that I will clarify from Surveyor about this. Besides, to console Jayachandra, I also told him that if he has difficulty in approaching Antony for resolve this issue, then I would not mind to provide a monetary refund for that 3ft * 60 ft (a total of 180 sq ft) even though the Antony claims that 3 ft of Site 58. I also told him that monetary value for the refund would be based on the sale rate of Rs 3750/- (based on Site 58 Deed's price). He stated that he will think through this and will let me know soon.

9) On 24th Mar 2019, I wrote an email to Jayachandra and his son Karthik, where I explained that total West side measure for the rear plots of sites 59 to 64 totals to 179 ft, where as the East Side bearing sites 55 to 58 totals to 182 ft. There is a 3 ft difference and the HV Reddy Layout map provided was merely a pictorial representation. Jayachandra's son (Karthik) replied back on the same day asking me to come and give measurements again for Site 58. In the same email, he also mentioned that they are putting RCC roof for ground floor.

10) On 17th Apr 2019, Jayachandra's son Karthik again sent another email to me asking me to come and give measurements. On the same day, I replied back to Jayachandra's son that I had been on travel for the last 2 weeks and have come to Chennai for voting. After voting, I again have some expected travel and I will come on 27th Apr 2019 to discuss.

11) On 28th Apr 2019, I visited the site along with my wife and found that apart from the Sump, the encroachment was also made for the Ground Floor RCC roofing for the same 3 ft.

12) On 29th Apr 2019, I came to your office and gave you the details for filing a civil case.
